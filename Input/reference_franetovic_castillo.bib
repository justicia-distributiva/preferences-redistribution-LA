abstract = {The recent resurgence of income inequality in some of the core societies has spawned a wide-ranging debate as to the culprits. Progress in this debate has been complicated by the fact that many of the theories that have been developed to account for the inequality upswing imply radically different patterns of distributional change, while predicting the same outcome in terms of the behavior of standard summary measures (e.g. a rise in the Gini coefficient or in Theil's inequality). Handcock and Morris (1999) have developed methods that allow the analyst to precisely identify patterns of distributional change and a set of summary measures to characterize such changes. These are based on the relative distribution, defined for our purposes as the ratio of the fraction of households in the baseline year to the fraction of households in the comparison year in each decile of the distribution of income. We use the available high-quality data from the Luxemburg Income Study to explore the evolution of household income inequality in 16 core societies. We describe exactly how inequality grew in some core societies since the late 1960s and discuss the extent to which patterns of distributional change were homogeneous or heterogeneous across the core. We find that: 1) rising inequality is generally associated with polarization, rather than upgrading or downgrading alone; 2) among those societies experiencing the largest increases in inequality, upgrading typically takes precedence over downgrading in the course of such polarization; and 3) declining inequality, where it occurs, has been the result of convergence, with the magnitude of the shift from the lower tail to the middle exceeding that of the shift from upper tail to the middle.

abstract = {Latin America is the most unequal region in the world and there is intense debate concerning the explanations and timing of such high levels of income inequality. Latin America was also the region, not including European Offshoots, which experienced the most rapid growth during the first globalization boom. It can, therefore, be taken as an interesting case of study regarding how globalization forces impinged on growth and income distribution in peripheral regions. This article presents a first estimate of income inequality in the Southern Cone of South America (Brazil 1872 and 1920, Chile 1870 and 1920, Uruguay 1920) and some assumptions concerning Argentina (1870 and 1920), and Uruguay (1870). We find an increasing trend towards inequality between 1870 and 1920, which can be explained as a process of inequality both within individual countries and among countries. This trend is discussed along three lines: the relationship between inequality and per capita income levels; the dynamics of the expansion to new areas; and movements of relative factor prices and of the terms of trade. During the current globalization process inequality remained apparently stable, as a result of contradictory movements: within-country inequality increased, especially in the three countries with the highest per capita income; on the other hand, between-country inequality was reduced due to the process of club-convergence among the Southern Cone countries. Divergence with core countries was deepened. Some implicit results seem to show that state-led industrialization was featured by decreasing inequality, both within and among countries. {\textcopyright} The Author(s), 2009.},

abstract = {A growing body of research connects diversity to anti-welfare attitudes and lower levels of social welfare expenditure, yet most evidence comes from analyses of US states or comparisons of the United States to Europe. Comparative analyses of European nation-states, however, yield little evidence that immigration – measured at the country-level – reduces support for national welfare state programs. This is not surprising, given that research suggests that the impact of diversity occurs at smaller, sub-national geographic units. Therefore, in this article, we test the hypothesis that immigration undermines welfare attitudes by assessing the impact of immigration measured at the regional-level on individual-level support for redistribution, a comprehensive welfare state, and immigrants' social rights. To do this, we combine data from the European Social Survey with a unique regional dataset compiled from national censuses, Eurostat, and the European Election Database (13 countries, 114 regions, and 23,213 individuals). Utilizing multilevel modeling, we find a negative relationship between regional percent foreign-born and support for redistribution as well as between regional percent foreign-born and support for a comprehensive welfare state. Objective immigration, however, does not increase opposition to immigrants' social rights (i.e. welfare chauvinism). We discuss the implications of these results and conclude that traditional welfare state attitudes and welfare chauvinism are distinct phenomena that should not be conflated in future research.},

abstract = {This article explores the empirical support for the two rival perspectives of diversity and postmaterialism, each of which predicts different patterns and trends of social solidarity in the Western world. The diversity perspective holds that ethnocultural heterogeneity undermines social solidarity, and consequently expects social solidarity to be weaker in more heterogeneous societies. In the diversity logic, social solidarity should have declined in Western societies as these societies have become more diverse due to continuous immigration. Postmaterialism theory, by contrast, posits a positive link between postmaterialism and social solidarity, and would expect social solidarity to have increased because of rising levels of postmaterialism across the Western world. This article found no relation between diversity and social solidarity at either the individual or the national level in cross-sectional analyses of WVS and EVS survey data. Neither was the diversity argument supported by trend data on opinions about the poor. The positive relations between postmaterialism and social solidarity on the other hand did confirm the postmaterialism perspective. Still, as postmaterialism contributed little to explaining the variance in social solidarity at the individual level and as there was no connection between postmaterialism and social solidarity at the macro-level, it can be questioned whether the solidaristic sentiments expressed by postmaterialists are sufficiently deep and lasting to underpin robust welfare policies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {In this article, we examine the impact of multicultural immigration policy on the degree to which immigration reduces support for redistributive social policy among natives. Arguments linking immigration to support for redistributive social policy are hotly contested. Some suggest that immigration reduces support for social policy, while others suggest that it increases such support. To make matters worse, the empirical evidence is equally mixed. We take this confluence as a puzzle in need of explanation. Our point of departure is to introduce institutional context and multicultural immigration policy, in particular, as a key intervening factor. From the growing literature on multiculturalism, we derive three unique hypotheses by which immigration has different effects on native support for redistributive social policy across multicultural contexts. To subject these to empirical scrutiny, we examine the degree to which the effect of immigration on native support for redistributive social policy (regarding jobs, unemployment, income, retirement, housing, and healthcare) varies across multicultural context. Our findings suggest that immigration flows appear to positively affect support for social policy in countries with a high degree of multiculturalism. For some types of social policy, immigration flows actually increase support for social policy in highly multicultural countries but reduces such support in assimilationist countries. However, cross-national variation in immigrant stocks is uncorrelated with support for social policy regardless of the level of multiculturalism. We conclude by highlighting how our findings point to the need for more research on how multiculturalism impacts native perceptions of immigrants.},

Intergroup contact theory and arguments from the 'new cosmopolitanism' debate suggest that cross-border social contacts ('social globalization') foster a willingness to include and accept newcomers. However, group conflict theory suggests that trade openness ('economic globalization') can unleash feelings of insecurity and trigger welfare chauvinism. While these approaches point in different directions, we argue that the impact of globalization on welfare chauvinism differs across socio-economic status groups. Using cross-national data from the European Social Survey 2008/2009, we find scarce support for the hypothesis that social globalization reduces welfare chauvinism in general. However, there is evidence that it diminishes exclusionary attitudes among those with relatively high socio-economic statuses. Moreover, we find no general evidence for an impact of economic globalization on chauvinism, but a positive interaction of intensified engagement with global market forces and higher socio-economic status. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

However, young welfare states in developing countries are emerging in response to different pressures than those faced by early welfare state; while globalization influences both young and established welfare states. Using newly released data for Latin America, this article provides a systematic comparison of social spending, spending on welfare and social security and government health spending in the OECD and Latin America and the Caribbean in the 1980s and 1990s. Results from cross-section time-series models indicate that the logic of industrialism welfare state approach is useful for examining social spending in Latin America. Namely, unemployment is associated with higher levels of social spending and spending on welfare and social security in both regions while a larger proportion of elderly population is associated with higher spending in Latin America. Globalization in the form of trade openness is associated with lower spending in the OECD across outcomes. In Latin America and the Caribbean the presence of international financial institutions powerfully pattern health and social spending: decreasing spending on welfare and social security and increasing health spending. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

However, the existing studies find that people are most negative about the mis-targeting of welfare benefits – that is, people are particularly critical of the high overuse (misuse or fraud) and high underuse (non-take-up) of welfare benefits. This study contributes to the current literature by more extensively analyzing perceptions of the overuse and underuse of welfare benefits by revealing the underlying perceptions of moral failure or failed administrative implementation. We also assess how different individual- and contextual-level factors influence those perceptions. We use data from the European Social Survey 2008/2009 for 25 European countries. We find that instead of representing two manifestations of the same concept of mis-targeting, perceptions of the overuse and underuse of benefits appear to be driven by normative ideas and opinions about the administrative effectiveness of the welfare state. Whereas normative ideas about the overuse of benefits are mainly influenced by people's political ideology and the selectivity of the redistribution system, ideas about the effectiveness of benefits are mainly influenced by people's institutional trust, the quality of the welfare state and the economic context. We conclude that critical attitudes toward the welfare state have multiple dimensions and can be both substantive and procedural in nature.},

The analysis supports the new institutionalist expectation that the effects of each of these conditions are configurational and dependent upon the presence or absence of other conditions, including value orientations. This can help to explain why previous findings on the independent effect of democracy on corruption have been mixed.

The first regards the definition and measurement of the concept of social cohesion. The second issue concerns the identification of the aspects of social inequality that affect the overall level of social cohesion. More precisely, I investigate two main hypotheses: the first argues the existence of a direct negative association between economic inequality and social cohesion. The second states that this relation is influenced by other aspects of social inequality such as the individuals' position in the stratification system and the educational level. The third issue introduces the comparative analysis that has been based on the welfare regime approach. More specifically, I hypothesize that welfare state is relevant because it influences both the relationship between social position and economic inequality, and the relationship between social cohesion and economic inequality. Data from the first round of the 2002 European Social Survey have been analysed applying structural equation models in order to measure social cohesion and to estimate the effects, both direct and indirect, exerted by the different dimensions of inequalities on social cohesion. Moreover, through a multi-group analysis, I investigate the effects resulting from the different welfare regimes.

This article proposes a model of other-regarding preferences for redistribution, which we term income-dependent altruism. Our model predicts that an individual's preferred level of redistribution is decreasing in income, increasing in inequality, and, more importantly, that the inequality effect is increasing in income. Thus, even though the rich prefer less redistribution than the poor, the rich are more responsive, in a positive way, to changes in inequality than are the poor. We contrast these results with several other prominent alternatives of other-regarding behavior. Using data for the United States from 1978 to 2010, we find significant support for our claims.},

An alternative approach is developed in which welfare regimes are operationalised using a range of theoretically defining characteristics, e.g. total public social spending, benefit generosity, and the weight of social services relative to total public social expenditure. Using data on 13 Western European countries from the first two waves of the European Social Survey, the empirical analysis provides mixed support for the hypothesized relationship between welfare regimes and support for redistribution.

  abstract = {In this paper we analyse how different welfare state regimes affect popular support for redistribution across 15 Western European countries. We suggest that the main reasons why previous studies have not been able to connect welfare state regimes and popular attitudes towards the welfare state is due to an improper and reductionist operationalisation of welfare state regimes, failure to distinguish empirical country `cases' from theoretical regime types, and finally improper handling of statistical methodologies. Rather than treating countries as `perfect' representations of different welfare state regimes, in the paper we assess countries' degree of belonging to welfare state regimes along a range of theoretically defined characteristics: level and composition of public social spending, strength of left- wing political power, and degree of neo-corporatism. Utilising data from the European Social Survey and the third wave of the European Values Study, and by means of an ordered mixed probit model with concomitant variables, we find strong evidence that structural characteristics affect mass opinion in a manner consistent with regime theory. For example, public support for redistribution increases with total social expenditure relative to GDP, family benefits, and active labour market policies. Furthermore, we find that institutionalised left-wing political power as measured by left-wing government seats and neo-corporatism are significant predictors of support for redistribution.},

The results of a two-level hierarchical model suggest that moral commitment to the welfare state dominates at the individual level, whereas self-interest enters the picture mainly if a person is highly dependent on the provisions of the welfare state.

However, existing empirical research has disputed this claim.

The main findings are that inequality is positively associated with demand for redistribution, and that the median income person is sensitive to the level of inequality. These findings are robust to the inclusion of a range of relevant control variables. The results are relevant in relation to the increase in inequalities in many European countries, and especially relevant to the current debate about the importance of directly observable differences in public preferences for social policy outcomes.},

Does inequality in the distribution of income increase or decrease in the course of a country's economic growth? What factors determine the secular level and trends of income inequalities? These are broad questions in a field of study that has been plagued by looseness in definitions, unusual scarcity of data, and pressures of strongly held opinions. While we cannot completely avoid the resulting difficulties, it may help to specify the characteristics of the size-of-income distributions that we want to examine and the movements of which we want to explain. Five specifications may be listed. First, the units for which incomes are recorded and grouped should be family-expenditure units, properly adjusted for the number of persons in each-rather than income re-cipients for whom the relations between receipt and use of income can be widely diverse. Second, the distribution should be complete, i.e., should cover all units in a country rather than a segment either at the upper or lower tail. Third, if possible we should segregate the units whose main income earners are either still in the learning or already in the retired stages of their life cycle-to avoid complicating the picture by including incomes not associated with full-time, full-fledged participa-tion in economic activity. Fourth, income should be defined as it is now for national income in this country, i.e., received by individuals, in-cluding income in kind, before and after direct taxes, excluding capital gains. Fifth, the units should be grouped by secular levels of income, free of cyclical and other transient disturbances. For such a distribution of mature expenditure units by secular levels * Presidential address delivered at the Sixty-seventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association, Detroit, Michigan, December 29, 1954.},

  volume = {100},
  abstract = {tandard political economy models of redistribution, notably that of Meltzer and Richard (1981), fail to account for the remarkable variance in government redistribution across democracies. We develop a general model of redistribution that explains why some democratic governments are more prone to redistribute than others. We show that the electoral system plays a key role because it shapes the nature of political parties and the composition of governing coalitions, hence redistribution. Our argument implies (1) that center-left governments dominate under PR systems, whereas center-right governments dominate under majoritarian systems; and (2) that PR systems redistribute more than majoritarian systems. We test our argument on panel data for redistribution, government partisanship, and electoral system in advanced democracies. s Why do some countries redistribute more than others? Most work on the politics of redis tribution starts from the premise that demo cratic institutions empower those who stand to benefit from redistribution. The basic logic is succinctly cap tured in the Meltzer-Richard (1981) model, where the voter with the median income is also the decisive voter. With a typical right-skewed distribution of income, the median voter will push for redistributive spending up to the point where the benefit of such spending to the median voter is outweighed by the efficiency costs of distortionary taxation. This argument implies that redistibution is much greater in democracies than in nondemocracies (at least of the right-authoritarian variety), and that, among the latter, inegalitarian societies redistribute more than egalitarian ones. There is some evidence to support the first implication, although it is disputed (see Ross 2005), but most of the variance in redistribution is probably within the same regime type. According to data from the Luxembourg Income Study, for example, the reduction in the poverty rate in United States as a result of taxation and transfers was 13\% in 1994, whereas the comparable figure for Sweden was 82\%},

  abstract = {According to the 'median-voter' hypothesis, greater inequality in the market distribution of earnings or income tends to produce greater generosity in redistri-butive policy. We outline the steps in the causal chain specified by the hypothesis and attempt to assess these steps empirically. Prior studies focusing on cross-country variation have found little support for the median-voter model. We examine over-time trends in eight nations during the 1980s and 1990s. Here too the median-voter hypothesis appears to have little utility. Income inequality has two components: (a) 'market' inequality and (b) govern-ment redistribution via taxes and transfers. In principle, the two can be combined in any of a variety of ways: low market inequality with high redistribution, low market inequality with low redistribution, high market inequality with moderate redistribution and so on. Of particular interest in the study of inequality is what happens when market inequality is high or increases. Does government compen-sate with high redistribution in order to secure a relatively egalitarian distribution of posttax \textendash{} posttransfer income? According to one influential theoretical approach, that is indeed what tends to happen. This approach is based on a median-voter model of the politics of redis-tribution. Its best-known exposition is by Allan Meltzer and Scott Richard (1981). A higher level of market inequality implies a greater distance between mean and median (pretax \textendash{} pretransfer) income, with the latter further below the former. The lower the median relative to the mean, the more the median income person or household is likely to benefit from government redistribution, in the sense that the transfers she receives will exceed her share of the tax burden. Hence the greater the amount of redistribution she will favor. More market inequality thus leads to political demand for more generous redistributive policy, which in a reasonably responsive democratic polity should result in exactly that.},

In this article, I study three different meanings of poverty: the individualistic, the fatalistic and the structural. I explore whether different meanings can be attributed to specific socio-demographic characteristics, economic circumstances and attitudes towards the welfare state. The data derive from a cross-sectional survey conducted in Finland in 2005 and the results indicate that there is strong consensus in the Finnish population on the causes of poverty. Finns are more likely to blame the flaws and inadequacies of the labour market than the behaviour of individuals or societal injustice. In other words, structural explanations of poverty have the greatest support. However, fatalistic explanations are also supported, since a considerable proportion of people regard bad luck and lack of opportunities as reasons for poverty. Applied multivariate analysis indicates that perceptions of the causes of poverty are at least to some extent related to socio-demographic characteristics, economic circumstances and attitudes to the welfare state. However, the effects, as well as the group differences, are small.},

What is less well explored is the reverse channel: that poverty may, in fact, be part of the reason for a country's poor growth performance. This more elabborated view of the development process opens the door to the existence of vicious circles in which low growth results in high poverty and high poverty in turn results in low growth. Poverty Reduction and Growth is about the existence of these vicious circles in Latin America and the Caribbean about the ways and means to convert them into virtuous circles in which poverty reduction and high growth reinforce each other. Through its analysis of fresh data and the attention it pays to issues such as the persistent inequality in the region, the role played by various microdeterminants of income, and the potential existence of human capital underinvestment traps, this title should be a valuable contribution to the current regional debate on poverty and growth, a debate that is critical to the design of policies conducive to enhancing welfare in all is dimensions among the poor of Latin America and the Caribbean."},

In contrast with the Western European experience, more developed welfare systems evolved in countries relatively closed to international trade, while the recent process of globalization that has swept the region has put substantial downward pressure on social security expenditures. Health and education spending has been relatively protected from greater exposure to international markets and has actually increased substantially with the shift to democracy.},

Stephan Haggard and Robert Kaufman trace the historical origins of social policy in these regions to crucial political changes in the mid-twentieth century, and show how the legacies of these early choices are influencing welfare reform following democratization and globalization. After World War II, communist regimes in Eastern Europe adopted wide-ranging socialist entitlements while conservative dictatorships in East Asia sharply limited social security but invested in education. In Latin America, where welfare systems were instituted earlier, unequal social-security systems favored formal sector workers and the middle class. Haggard and Kaufman compare the different welfare paths of the countries in these regions following democratization and the move toward more open economies. Although these transformations generated pressure to reform existing welfare systems, economic performance and welfare legacies exerted a more profound influence. The authors show how exclusionary welfare systems and economic crisis in Latin America created incentives to adopt liberal social-policy reforms, while social entitlements from the communist era limited the scope of liberal reforms in the new democracies of Eastern Europe. In East Asia, high growth and permissive fiscal conditions provided opportunities to broaden social entitlements in the new democracies. This book highlights the importance of placing the contemporary effects of democratization and globalization into a broader historical context.},

We bring new evidence to bear on this debate with an analysis of three welfare state measures and a comprehensive array of economic globalization indicators for 17 affluent democracies from 1975 to 2001. The analysis suggests several conclusions. First, state-of-the-art welfare state models warrant revision in the globalization era. Second, most indicators of economic globalization do not have significant effects, but a few affect the welfare state and improve models of welfare state variation. Third, the few significant globalization effects are in differing directions and often inconsistent with extant theories. Fourth, the globalization effects are far smaller than the effects of domestic political and economic factors.

Higher inequality is thought to increase demand for income redistribution in democracies and to discourage democratization and promote class conflict and revolution in dictatorships. Most such arguments crucially assume that ordinary people know how high inequality is, how it has been changing, and where they fit in the income distribution. Using a variety of large, cross-national surveys, we show that, in recent years, ordinary people have had little idea about such things. What they think they know is often wrong. Widespread ignorance and misperceptions emerge robustly, regardless of data source, operationalization, and measurement method. Moreover, perceived inequality\textemdash{}not the actual level\textemdash{}correlates strongly with demand for redistribution and reported conflict between rich and poor. We suggest that most theories about political effects of inequality need to be reframed as theories about effects of perceived inequality.},

Each country data set contains a variable called " WT " which should be activated to produce representative national results. In the SPSS version of these data sets, the weight variable should be activated. In STATA the weight variable can be activated through the svy setting: svyset upm [pw=wt], strata (estratopri). In this case, all STATA commands should use the pre-fix svy (for example svy: mean q2 or svy: tab etid ur). This is preferable since this takes into account the complex nature of our samples, that is, the use of stratification, clustering, and weighting. Because of this, it is necessary to take into account the design effect when analysing our surveys to have better precision and to not incorrectly assume that the data have been collected using simple random samples knowing that the design effect can increase or decrease the standard error of a variable, which will then make the confidence intervals either increase or decrease. Another way to activate the weight in STATA is to specify the weight variable for each command. We recommend to use iweight when running frequency distributions, for example, tab q1 [iw=wt].}

It presents information on international students, including a first attempt to calculate the rates at which these students remain in their host countries after the completion of their studies. This publication also explores the main changes introduced in migration policies, including new laws governing immigrant entry, stay and access to the labour market. The selective recruitment of immigrants according to labour market needs and points-based systems is described, as well as measures to facilitate the integration of immigrants. International co-operation to improve border control and to combat irregular migration is analysed in detail. The impact of the economic crisis on the labour market outcomes of immigrants is examined, taking into consideration gender, sectors of employment and different types of contracts, as well as the demographic dynamics of native and foreign-born populations during the period under review. The reader will also find in this book two special chapters on topical issues. The first addresses the determinants of public opinion regarding migration, reviewing opinion surveys to identify individual determinants and examining the role of different stakeholders in shaping opinion. The second chapter presents an in-depth study of the impact of naturalisation on the labour market outcomes of immigrants, exploring how acquisition of citizenship can increase opportunities. Country notes, together with standardised tables, describe recent developments in migration movements and policies. The statistical annex contains the latest data on migration flows, foreign and foreign-born populations, and naturalisations.

On one hand, confidence in the system should be negatively related to political engagement, insofar as it entails reduced desire for social change; on the other hand, system confidence should also be positively related to political engagement to the extent that it carries an assumption that the system is responsive to citizens' political efforts. Because of the combination of these 2 opposing forces, the motivation for political engagement should be highest at intermediate levels of system confidence. Five studies revealed a negative quadratic relationship between system confidence and normative political engagement. In 2 representative surveys, Polish participants with moderate levels of system confidence were more likely to vote in political elections (Study 1) and to participate in solidarity-based collective action (Study 2). Two field studies demonstrated a negative quadratic relationship between system confidence and actual participation in political demonstrations (gender equality and teachers' protests in Poland; Studies 3 and 4). This pattern of results was further corroborated by analyses of data from 50 countries drawn from the World Value Survey: we observed negative quadratic relationships between system confidence and collective action as well as voting. These relation-ships were stronger in democratic (vs. nondemocratic) regimes (Study 5). Our results suggest that some degree of system confidence might be useful to stimulate political engagement within the norms of the system.},

  doi = {10.1177/0001699315622801},
  abstract = {The acceptance of income differences varies across countries. This article suggests belief in three narratives of modernity to account for this: the ''tunnel effect,'' related to perceptions of generational mobility; the ''procedural justice effect,'' related to the perceived fairness in the process of getting ahead; and the ''middle-class effect,'' related to perceptions of the social structure of society. The importance of the suggested narratives is tested by means of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2009 module, which includes 38 countries. The finding is that belief in the three narratives can account for a considerable part of the cross-national variation. Beliefs in procedural justice and the existence of a middle-class society clearly go together with high acceptance of current income differences, while the ''tunnel effect'' is more complex. In general, belief in generational mobility goes together with accep-tance of current income differences. But personal experience of such upward social mobility actually lowers acceptance of current income differences, especially if overall generational mobility in society is believed to be backward. The framework explains most country-cases, which points to the existence of general patterns. But the models also indicate that the Phi-lippines, and to a lesser extent the US and France, are special cases.},

In regard to the structural position thesis, the reflection thesis and dominant ideology thesis, this article examines how much income inequality people will accept before deciding that the disparity is too large and how societal differences can be explained adequately. For this purpose, the attitudes of about 35,000 respondents in 30 countries are investigated. A multi-level analysis is carried out using data from the ISSP survey `Social Inequality III' of 1999. At the societal level, both socio-economic and cultural characteristics are considered. While much research places emphasis on dominant ideologies, this analysis in addition attempts to grasp these ideologies by aggregating individual beliefs. It is shown that societal differences are well explained by ideologies, but that socio-economic characteristics are important as well. At the micro-level, several individual characteristics are considered. Among other things, people at the top of the vertical axis are less critical than those at the bottom. There are also substantial differences between societies in regard to how much inequality in income ratio will be accepted. Thus, people not only accept different amounts of income, they even have different preferences about which ratio is just.},

To find out, hypotheses are tested using survey data from the International Social Survey Programme, comparing several state-socialist societies with several market societies both before (1987) and after (1992) the political and economic transformation. Before the transformation, the public in central and eastern Europe was much more egalitarian than in market-regulated societies. The results show that the amount of income inequality that people think legitimate has increased in all countries, but the increase was far more dramatic in former state-socialist than in market-regulated societies. Differences in the class and demographic composition of the population hardly explain variations in inequality attitudes between societies, but differences in perceptions of income inequality do.

  abstract = {Abstract A classic topic in the sociology of inequality lies in the subjective consequences of people's stratification position. Many studies have shown that education and occupational class have significant effects on attitudes, but little is known about how the magnitude of these effects depends on the societal context. There has been debate in the scholarly literature, with some authors arguing that effects of class and education are less important when societies are more developed, whereas other authors argue that effects are either stable (for class) or increasing (for education). We use a meta-analytical design to address this debate. More specifically we examine the effects of class and education for a broad range of attitudes (21 scales) in 22 European countries using data from the 1999 wave of the European Values Study. We pool summary-measures of association (Eta-values) into a new dataset and analyse these Eta-values (N = 453) applying multilevel models with characteristics of countries and characteristics of attitudes as the independent variables. Our results show that there is no evidence that the effects of class on attitudes are lower when countries are more modern, but we do find larger effects of education in more modern countries.},

Social mobilization drives more substantial redistribution by counterbalancing business power and focusing incumbents on securing social peace and surviving in office. By characterizing distinctive features of social-policy politics and tax-policy politics and theorizing linkages between the two realms, we contribute to broader debates on the relative influence of voters versus organized interests in policymaking. We apply our theory to explain ``least-likely'' cases of redistributive policies under conservative governments in Mexico (2006-2012) and Chile (2010-2014).},

Four perspectives are discussed explaining cross-national differences in views on inequality: the modernist, the culturalist, the micro and the macro perspective. The findings of studies comparing views on inequalities in post-communist and Western states provide more support for the modernist than for the culturalist perspective. Few comparative studies appear to investigate views on inequalities as independent variables impacting on other social attitudes and behaviours. It is argued that the social relevance of the field will be enhanced if more studies can show that views on inequality have an effect on social outcomes complementary to that of objective inequalities.},

While previous research has explored the shape of stratification across nations and citizens' normative attitudes towards inequality, scant attention has been given to citizens' perceptions of actual stratification across welfare regimes. Using the 1999 International Social Survey Programme, we compare perceptions of inequality in Germany, Sweden, and the United States. More specifically, we ask how the stratification reality in each country is assessed by its citizens, whether it meets their stratification aspirations, and whether these perceptions differ systematically both across and within welfare regimes. Our results show that perceptions vary in a clear and meaningful way across countries as well as between different social groups within a given welfare regime. For instance, Americans are more likely to view society as unequal, but only slightly more likely to prefer that extent of inequality. Conversely, the Swedish clearly view their society as more equal than citizens in the United States and Germany, yet not nearly as equal as they would like it to be. Our multivariate results reveal important similarities and differences as well, such as socio-economic cleavages in the United States, and cleavages between labour market insiders and outsiders in Germany.},

  abstract = {Ariely surprised social scientists and laypersons alike with the claim that Americans on both sides of the political aisle tend to grossly underestimate wealth inequality in the United States. The data Norton and Ariely presented were indeed quite striking: When asked to guess the percentage of wealth owned by each quintile of the population from richest to poorest, participants misjudged by substantial margins the top (59\% estimated vs. 84\% actual) and bot-tom (4\% estimated vs. 0.1\% actual) of the distribution. Both errors favored equality, and overall participants moved wealth from the top quintile to the bottom three quintiles. Moreover, most participants, irrespective of their political affiliations, reported that they would be happier living in a country with even greater equality than indicated by their too-generous estimates. Thus, according to Norton and Ariely, the welter of highly vis-ible disagreements between liberal and conservative pol-icymakers concerning the optimal distribution of wealth may actually belie an underlying (and decidedly liberal) consensus among the American public. Recent evidence suggests that Norton and Ariely's (2011) provocative findings may reflect a large degree of measurement error. Specifically, Eriksson and Simpson (2012) compared Norton and Ariely's method\textemdash{}asking study participants to grasp the abstract concept of aggre-gated net worth across households (i.e., the percentage of the country's overall wealth owned by each quintile)\textemdash{} with a method involving a logically equivalent but com-putationally simpler criterion\textemdash{}the average wealth of individual households within a given quintile. They found that the latter (average) method yielded dramati-cally higher estimates of wealth inequality than the for-mer (percentage) approach. More important, by showing that this same measurement disparity also occurs in other domains with high levels of inequality (e.g., the number of visits to various Web pages), Eriksson and Simpson revealed a likely source of the difference: the well-documented anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic (see Chapman \& Johnson, 2002), which causes people to esti-mate and (under)adjust an unknown quantity relative to an anchor point.},

We outline the steps in the causal chain specified by the hypothesis and attempt to assess these steps empirically. Prior studies focus-ing on cross-country variation have found little support for the median-voter model. We examine over-time trends in eight nations during the 1980s and 1990s. Here too the median-voter hypothesis appears to have little utility. Income inequality has two components: (1) "market" inequality and (2) govern-ment redistribution via taxes and transfers. In principle, the two can be combined in any of a variety of ways: low market inequality with high redistribution, low market inequality with low redistribution, high market inequality with moderate redistribution, and so on. Of particular interest in the study of inequality is what happens when market inequality is high or increases. Does government compen-sate with high redistribution in order to secure a relatively egalitarian distribution of posttax-posttransfer income? According to one influential theoretical approach, that is indeed what tends to happen. This approach is based on a median-voter model of the politics of re-distribution. Its best-known exposition is by Allan Meltzer and Scott Richard (1981). A higher level of market inequality implies a greater distance between},

Abstract In recent years much research has investigated whether values , social norms , and attitudes differ across countries and whether these differences have measurable effects on economic behavior . One area in which such studies are particularly relevant is tax compliance , given both the noted differences across countries in their levels of tax compliance and the marked inability of standard economic models of taxpayer compliance to explain these differences . In the face of these difficulties , many researchers have suggested that the intrinsic motivation for individuals to pay taxes \textendash{} what is sometimes termed their " tax morale " \textendash{} differs across countries . However , isolating the reasons for these differences in tax morale is notoriously difficult . In a common approach , studies sometimes referred to as " cultural studies " have often relied upon controlled laboratory experiments conducted in different countries because such experiments can be set up with identical experimental protocols to allow cultural effects to be isolated . In this paper we first analyze a cross - section of individuals in Spain and the United States using the World Values Survey (WVS) . In line with previous experiments , our findings indicate a significantly higher tax morale in the United States than in Spain , controlling in a multivariate analysis for additional variables . We then extend our multivariate analysis to include 14 European countries in the estimations . Our results again indicate that the United States has the highest tax morale across all countries , followed by Austria and Switzerland . We also find a strong negative correlation between the size of shadow economy and the degree of tax morale in those countries .},

We first examine the historical origin and evolution of social protection systems in developing coun-tries, arguing that insufficient attention has been paid to the authoritar-ian roots of developing nations' social policy. As a preliminary effort to remedy this shortcoming in the literature, we offer a political logic for the observed variation in the character of institutions of social policy es-tablished by nondemocratic regimes. Next, we explore recent research examining linkages between models of economic development and wel-fare regimes in developing countries. Finally, we turn to the study of the political determinants of the social policy reforms that occurred in the final decades of the twentieth century, arguing that variation in reform across policy areas has been more complex than is generally appreci-ated in the literature. To explain this variation, we develop a theory that identifies the political coalitions supporting different policy outcomes. 93},

To the extent policy outcomes reflect individual pref-erences, then countries with higher levels of religiosity should have lower levels of welfare state spending. In formalizing our argument we also suggest that if benefits from religion are subject to a network externality (I derive greater plea-sure from religion when others are also religious), it is possible for countries that are similar in terms of underlying conditions to exhibit multiple equilibria with respect to religion and social insurance. We empirically test our predictions using individual-level data on religiosity, individual-level data on social insurance pref-erences, and cross-country data on social spending outcomes. The findings are strongly supportive of our hypotheses. One of the major puzzles for political economy involves the question why some govern-ments adopt policies that intervene heavily to redistribute income from rich to poor and to provide social insurance against adverse events, while other governments do much},

Leslie McCall contends that such assumptions are based on both incomplete survey data and economic conditions of the past and not present. In fact, Americans have desired less inequality for decades, and McCall's book explains why. Americans become most concerned about inequality in times of inequitable growth, when they view the rich as prospering while opportunities for good jobs, fair pay and high quality education are restricted for everyone else. As a result, they favor policies to expand opportunity and redistribute earnings in the workplace, reducing inequality in the market rather than redistributing income after the fact with tax and spending policies. This book resolves the paradox of how Americans can express little enthusiasm for welfare state policies and still yearn for a more equitable society, and forwards a new model of preferences about income inequality rooted in labor market opportunities rather than welfare state policies.},

This transformation has had enor-mous social and political consequences. In this research note, I assess the influence of both income inequality and the changing structure of income inequality on Americans' public policy mood. Numerous politi-cal theorists suggest that rising inequality and the shift in the distribu-tion of income to those at the top should lead to increasing support for liberal policies. But recent evidence contradicts these theories. I empiri-cally evaluate a number of competing theoretical predictions about the relationship between inequality and public preferences. In general, the evidence supports the claim that rising inequality has been a force pro-moting conservatism in the American public. The distribution of income in America has shifted toward the very wealthy over the past thirty years (Piketty and Saez 2003), making it the most unequal of advanced democracies (Piketty and Saez 2006). 1 Some have even labeled the contemporary economic distribution a " new Gilded Age " (Bartels 2008). How is the public likely to respond to rising inequality? In this research note, I evaluate competing expectations about this relationship stemming from rational models of public opinion (Meltzer and Richard 1981; B{\'e}nabou 2000), models of public opinion rooted in theories of social affinity (Lupu 1. There is some disagreement regarding the increase in inequality and whether inequality is declining (Gordon 2009).

  abstract = {In cross-sectional studies, countries with greater income inequality typically exhibit less support for government-led redistribution and greater acceptance of wage inequality (e.g., United States versus Western Europe). If individual nations evolve along this pattern, a vicious cycle could form with reduced social concern amplifying primal increases in inequality due to forces like skill-biased technical change. Exploring movements around these long-term levels, however, this study finds mixed evidence regarding the vicious cycle hypothesis. On one hand, larger compensation differentials are accepted as inequality grows. This growth in differentials is of a smaller magnitude than the actual increase in inequality, but it is nonetheless positive and substantial in size. Weighing against this, growth in inequality is met with greater support for government-led redistribution to the poor. These patterns suggest that short-run inequality shocks can be reinforced in the labor market but do not result in weaker political preferences for redistribution.},

Three out of every four people polled said that the difference in incomes between rich people and poor people has increased in the past 20 years, and most of them added that that is a bad thing\textemdash{}but most of those people still supported the regressive 2001 Bush tax cut and the even more regressive repeal of the estate tax.

La desigualdad, as{\'\i} vista, pierde su condici{\'o}n cotidiana \textendash{}esa que deja ver la prensa, los discursos, las cifras\textendash, deviniendo en una interrogante profunda sobre las relaciones sociales, la pervivencia de la democracia y los fundamentos de la justicia. En segundo lugar, a diferencia de la disciplina econ{\'o}mica, centrada en pro-poner en la actualidad evaluaciones y modelos estad{\'\i}sticos para pr{\'a}cticamente todos los temas concernientes al estudio de las sociedades, y muy especialmente para la desigualdad (como la siempre influyente Curva de Kuznets, el {\'\i}ndice de Theil o el Coeficiente de Gini, entre otros), facilitando la creaci{\'o}n de rankings mundiales de las m{\'a}s diversas tem{\'a}ticas, Rosanvallon opta por el desarrollo de un modelo explicativo radicalmente distinto, uno que da primac{\'\i}a a una perspec-tiva hist{\'o}rica y te{\'o}rica. As{\'\i}, si bien algunos trabajos recientes van m{\'a}s all{\'a} de la primera caracter{\'\i}stica, 1 aproxim{\'a}ndose integralmente al fen{\'o}meno, pocos logran ir m{\'a}s all{\'a} de las descripciones estad{\'\i}sticas, que adem{\'a}s de evidenciar la alta des-igualdad aporten una visi{\'o}n comprehensiva, para interpretar el presente y sugerir direcciones hacia el futuro. El recorrido que ofrece este libro sustenta la presunci{\'o}n del autor sobre la ne-cesidad de una nueva teor{\'\i}a de la justicia, y le alcanza el espacio tambi{\'e}n para un primer esbozo de ella. Se apoya en la inquietud de que nunca las desigualdades 1},

  abstract = {This paper examines the returns to the socioeconomic background of origin (or " class ") in the labor market in Chile. We employ individual data from several cohorts of graduates from the same program (Business and Economics) of a large and diverse public University in Chile. The data includes productivity measures uncommon in earnings differential studies, such as academic performance at University, school academic quality, and second language proficiency. Four measures of socioeconomic background are employed, which are significantly correlated. These are highly significant in explaining earnings despite their collinearity, and after controlling for various measures of productivity. The class wage gaps obtained by a Oxaca-Ramson decomposition amount to approximately 25 to 35 percent, which are remarkably higher than wage gaps reported in the literature for other workers' characteristics such as gender, race and physical appearance. Moreover, the effect of class is more important in determining earnings than academic performance at University. Future research must focus on explaining the causes of this large return to class. These may emerge from some combination of pure employer discrimination, productivity-enhancing discrimination from other parties (such as consumers, peers and suppliers), statistical discrimination by employers and " pure " class-related productivity. 1 We are grateful to Dante Contreras, Jos{\'e} Miguel Benavente, Pilar Romaguera, Osvaldo Larra{\~n}aga, Joseph Ramos and Rodrigo Montero for their valuable comments and suggestions.

The paper then focuses on the factors, which may explain such inequality decline. A review of the literature and an econometric test indicate that a few complementary factors played an important role in this regard, including a drop in the skill premium following a rapid expansion of secondary education, and the adoption of a new development model by a growing number of left-of-centre governments which emphasizes fiscally-prudent but more equitable macroeconomic, tax, social expenditure and labour policies. For the region as a whole, improvements in terms of trade, migrant remittances, FDI and world growth playeda less important role than expected although their impact was perceptible in countries where such transactions were sizeable.

Una primera respuesta a esta pregunta proviene del {\'a}mbito de las pol{\'\i}ticas p{\'u}blicas, donde se asume que en un sistema democr{\'a}tico el apoyo ciudadano es fundamental para otorgar una base de legitimidad al accionar pol{\'\i}tico. En esta l{\'\i}nea, Liebig y Mau (2007) se{\~n}alan que un sistema tributario percibido como justo posibilita que sea fortalecida la idea del pago de impuestos como una contribuci{\'o}n al bien com{\'u}n. De otra manera, y en particular en situaciones de alta desigualdad, existir{\'\i}a el riesgo de movilizaci{\'o}n pol{\'\i}tica por parte del votante medio manifestando demandas por redistribuci{\'o}n (Meltzer \& Richard, 1981), lo cual podr{\'\i}a llevar a inestabilidad social y a crisis de legitimidad del sistema democr{\'a}tico.

  abstract = {There has been great interest in the relationship between immigration and the welfare state in recent years, and particularly since Alesina and Glaeser's (2004) influential work. Following literatures on solidarity and fractionalization, race in the U.S. welfare state, and antiimmigrant sentiments, many contend that immigration undermines public support for social policy. This study analyzes three measures of immigration and six welfare attitudes using 1996 and 2006 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) data for 17 affluent democracies. Based on multi-level and two-way fixed-effects models, our results mostly fail to support the generic hypothesis that immigration undermines public support for social policy. The percent foreign born, net migration, and the 10-year change in the percent foreign born all fail to have robust significant negative effects on welfare attitudes. There is evidence that the percent foreign born significantly undermines the welfare attitude that government ``should provide a job for everyone who wants one.'' However, there is more robust evidence that net migration and change in percent foreign born have positive effects on welfare attitudes. We conclude that the compensation and chauvinism hypotheses provide greater potential for future research, and we critically consider other ways immigration could undermine the welfare state. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that factors other than immigration are far more important for public support of social policy.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the extent to which labor market dualization polarizes preferences on redistribution between formal and informal sector workers in Latin America and the Caribbean. Differences in welfare state costs and benefits for these labor market groups are likely to fuel diverging incentives regarding welfare consumption. The article tests whether or not informal workers are driven mainly by economic self-interest to increase gains from public welfare goods. The study employed a hierarchical model on pooled survey data from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) 2008 and 2010 to analyze the risk exposure of formal and informal workers and, subsequently, their preferences on redistribution. The analysis reveals that while economic self-interest is an influential factor for formal workers, it is (unexpectedly) much less so for informal workers. Also, an increased economically insecure environment, reflected by high unemployment rates, does not motivate informal workers to an exceptional degree to turn towards the state for redistribution, despite greater exposure to economic risk. Labor market dualization does not translate into polarization at the individual level regarding redistributive preferences in Latin America and the Caribbean.},

  volume = {5},
  doi = {10.1093/ser/mwl017},
  abstract = {This paper analyses levels and trends in within-country income inequality during the second-half of the 20th century. Two broad general trends were visible: beginning in the 1950s and 1960s inequality declined substantially in most coun-tries, and in the 1980s and 1990s it increased more variably and more slightly. However, we focus here on presenting and explaining the distinct 'macro-regional' regimes of inequality that became evident in this period. We identify six: Anglo, Nordic, Continental West European, Latin American, East Asian and South Asian. We show that intra-regional variations in inequality have been much less than inter-regional variations, and that the six regional regimes did not remain constant but had distinct trajectories through time. The Anglos were at first the most egalitarian, only later developing the greater inequality suppos-edly characteristic of their 'liberalism'. The Nordics only became the most egalitar-ian in the middle of our period. The Euro-Continentals began as the most unequal among the Western countries, but then became almost as equal as the Nordics. Latin America began and remained the most unequal region of all. East Asia was rather egalitarian, while South Asia converged towards a middling inequality. Though pressures towards more inequality strengthened from 1980, regional responses remained varied and path-dependent. Then, in more speculative vein, we seek to explain these regional patterns in macro-sociological terms. Beginning from a model of dynamic interactions between economic, ideological, military and political power relations, we trace the political institutionalization of distinct macro-regional ideologies of 'best practices' of socio-economic development.},

  volume = {59},
  abstract = {Why is income inequality higher in Latin America than in East Asia? Is this phe-nomenon related to the region's natural resource abundance? Is it a contributor to Latin America's slow and narrowly focused human capital accumulation? If so, can anything be done to reverse the Latin American trends, or should we think of the region's fate as unalterable? To help answer these questions, this paper draws upon standard trade theory and cross-sectional empirical analysis to demonstrate that natural-resource-intensive sectors, particularly permanent agriculture, absorb capital that might otherwise flow to manufactur-ing. This depresses workers' incentive to accumulate skill and delays industrialization. 1 This paper explores in detail one of the main themes of our larger and ongoing inquiry into the factors affecting Latin American income inequality.

We test these predictions both across nations within a single policy area (unemployment insurance) and across policy domains within a single polity (the United States, using a new survey).

We find that while differences in beliefs on what causes income differences seem to be important for explaining within-country variation in redistributive preferences, they do little to explain between-country differences. Differences in the effects of holding certain beliefs, however, are important for explaining between-country variation in redistributive preferences, suggesting considerable heterogeneity across societies in what is considered as fair.},

In a general equilibrium model with endogenous labor supply, a mixture of fair and selfish voters choose optimal policy through majority voting. First, we show that majority voting produces a unique winner in pairwise contests over feasible policies (the Condorcet winner). Second, we show that a preference for greater fairness leads to greater redistribution. An increase in the number of fair voters can also lead to greater redistribution. Third, we show that in economies where the majority are selfish-voters, the decisive policy could be chosen by fair-voters, and vice versa. Fourth, while choosing labor supply, even fair voters behave exactly like selfish voters. We show how this apparently inconsistent behavior in different domains (voting and labor supply) can be rationalized within the model.},

The specifications either indicate no relationship or a weak positive relationship. Our analysis supports two main conclusions: First, the direction of the relationship between redistributive preferences and immigration depends on the specific domain of the welfare state. Second, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the relationship differs across the different levels of jurisdictions. This second result suggests that the patterns found in the previous literature may not be robust to a disaggregation of the data to lower level of jurisdictions.

  abstract = {I ncreasing numbers of comparative survey datasets span multiple waves. Moving beyond purely cross-sectional analyses, multilevel longitudinal analyses of such datasets should generate substantively important insights into the political, social and economic correlates of many individual-level outcomes of interest (attitudes, behaviors, etc.). This article describes two simple techniques for extracting such insights, which allow change over time in y to be a function of change over time in x and/or of a time-invariant x. The article presents results from simulation studies that assess the techniques in the presence of complications that are likely to arise with real-world data, and concludes with applications to the issues of generalized social trust and postmaterialist values, using data from World/European Values Surveys. C omparative survey data consist of observations on survey respondents drawn from multiple countries or subnational jurisdictions such as states, provinces or metropolitan areas. 1 Comparing respondents from different jurisdictions can help to clarify how people differ depending on their social and political contexts, and to test theories about the consequences of macro-social conditions for individuals' attitudes, beliefs, circumstances and behaviors. Particularly in the last decade, multilevel models (also known as mixed, random effects or hierarchical linear models) have become a standard method of conducting analyses of this kind. Such models are useful for analyzing observations that are grouped or clustered. 2 Recent applications to comparative survey data have examined and sought to identify the covariates of outcomes like voting (Gelman et al. 2008), political attitudes (Jamal and Nooruddin 2010), union membership (Martin and Brady 2007), religiosity (Karakocnd Bas -kan 2012), health (Jen, Jones and Johnston 2009), poverty (Brady, Fullerton and Cross 2009) and gender gaps in household labor (Iversen and Rosenbluth 2006). This diversity of applications demonstrates the broad appeal of the method. Though they find many intriguing cross-sectional associations, very few of these studies address the issue of change over time, and how the kinds of individual-level outcomes},

  abstract = {One proposition of the popular median-voter hypothesis is a positive relationship between demand for redistribution and levels of inequality. However, empirical evi-dence of this relationship is scarce. A major shortcoming of previous research is that it is either cross-sectional, which casts general doubt on the causal nature of the esti-mates, or it is longitudinal and based on aggregated data, which makes it difficult to control for compositional effects or to analyze the individual-level implications of the hypothesis. This article estimates cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of inequality, while simultaneously controlling for the composition of data at the individual level. The article finds a positive within-country effect of inequality on demand for redistribution but no such relationship between countries. This finding points to an unobserved variable at the country level. Following the litera-ture, the article considers welfare regimes as a possible factor capturing these unobserved country differences. However, none of the existing welfare regime typ-ologies performs well in terms of capturing unobserved heterogeneity or in general explanatory power. All in all, the article finds robust support for the proposition that demand for redistribution is positively related to inequality, but it casts doubt on the utility of cross-sectional analysis and the welfare regime approach.},

Thus, modern analysts see today a more unequal Latin America compared with Asia and most rich post-industrial nations and assume that this must always have been true. Indeed, some have argued that high inequality appeared very early in the post-conquest Americas, and that this fact supported rent-seeking and anti-growth institutions which help explain the disappointing growth performance we observe there even today. The recent leveling of inequality in the region since the 1990s seems to have done little to erode that pessimism. It is important, therefore, to stress that this alleged persistence is based on an historical literature which has made little or no effort to be comparative, and it matters. Compared with the rest of the world, inequality was not high in the century following 1492, and it was not even high in the post-independence decades just prior Latin America's belle {\'e}poque and start with industrialization. It only became high during the commodity boom 1870-1913, by the end of which it had joined the rich country unequal club that included the US and the UK. Latin America only became relatively high between 1913 and the 1970s when it missed the Great Egalitarian Leveling which took place almost everywhere else.

We propose a political reinforcement hypothesis, suggesting that rising inequality moves party politics on welfare state issues to the right, strengthening rather than modifying the impact of inequality. We model policy platforms by incorporating ideology and opportunism of party members and interests and sympathies of voters. If welfare spending is a normal good within income classes, a majority of voters moves rightward when inequality increases. As a response, the left, in particular, shift their welfare policy platform toward less generosity. We find support for our arguments using data on the welfare policy platforms of political parties in 22 OECD countries.

In a general equilibrium model of a labor economy, the size of government, measured by the share of income redistributed, is de-termined by majority rule. Voters rationally anticipate the disincen-tive effects of taxation on the labor-leisure choices of their fellow citizens and take the effect into account when voting. The share of earned income redistributed depends on the voting rule and on the distribution of productivity in the economy. Under majority rule, the equilibrium tax share balances the budget and pays for the voters' choices. The principal reasons for increased size of government implied by the model are extensions of the franchise that change the position of the decisive voter in the income distribution and changes in relative productivity. An increase in mean income relative to the income of the decisive voter increases the size of government.},

Our theory posits that middle-income voters will be inclined to ally with low-income voters and support redistributive policies when the distance between the middle and the poor is small relative to the distance between the middle and the rich. We test this proposition with data from 15 to 18 advanced democracies and find that both redistribution and nonelderly social spending increase as the dispersion of earnings in the upper half of the distribution increases relative to the dispersion of earnings in the lower half of the distribution. In addition, we present survey evidence on preferences for redistribution among middle-income voters that is consistent with our theory and regression results indicating that left parties are more likely to participate in government when the structure of inequality is characterized by skew. T he recent growth of empirical scholarship on the politics of redistribution in advanced capitalist societies is impressive. Taking the canonical me-dian voter model associated with Romer (1975) and Meltzer and Richard (1981) as the point of departure, much of this research asks, " Does more inequality lead to more redistribution? " Although Kenworthy and Pontusson (2005) and Milanovic (2000) show that patterns of within-country variation broadly conform to the core prediction of the Romer-Meltzer-Richard (RMR) model, others point out that the cross-national association between income inequality and redistribu-tion among Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries is in fact the op-posite of what the canonical model seems to predict: Governments in less egalitarian countries tend to en-gage in less redistribution (e.g., Alesina and Glaeser 2004, 57\textendash{}60). Perhaps because of the difficulty of recon-ciling within-and cross-country evidence, the current consensus seems to be that inequality does not matter for the politics of redistribution, at least not in any direct and particularly significant way. Instead, recent studies emphasize the causal role of a range of other},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Popular beliefs about the causes of inequality are often thought to reflect the actual processes behind social stratification. We use the case of Latin America to challenge this assumption. In these rigid and unequal societies, people are more likely to believe that wealth and poverty depend on individual merits or faults rather than structural constraints. Drawing on data from the 2007 Social Cohesion Survey, we use multinomial logistic regression and counterfactual simulation to investigate the factors that drive popular beliefs about wealth and poverty at the individual level, as well its distribution across countries. Our findings provide partial support to theories maintaining that being in an advantaged social position leads to favoring individualistic beliefs. We, however, report a novel effect of social class. More importantly, we show that unobserved country-level factors are the most powerful predictors and the only source of cross-country variation in the distribution of beliefs about the origins of inequality, thus ruling out a compositional explanation for cross-country heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Many surveys of respondents from multiple countries or subnational regions have now been fielded on multiple occasions. Social scientists are regularly using multilevel models to analyse the data generated by such surveys, investigating variation across both space and time. We show, however, that such models are usually specified erroneously. They typically omit one or more relevant random effects, thereby ignoring important clustering in the data, which leads to downward biases in the standard errors. These biases occur even if the fixed effects are specified correctly; if the fixed effects are incorrect, erroneous specification of the random effects worsens biases in the coefficients. We illustrate these problems using Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical examples. Our recommendation to researchers fitting multilevel models to comparative longitudinal survey data is to include random effects at all potentially relevant levels, thereby avoiding any mismatch between the random and fixed parts of their models.},

Yet frequently they have not managed to do so. Indeed, Robin Hood works in both directions\$$\backslash$backslash\$nin LAC, with public transfers redistributing income to both the rich and the poor. The redistributive\$$\backslash$backslash\$nimpacts from social insurance are limited \textendash{} and even regressive in some countries. This regressivity\$$\backslash$backslash\$nderives from two main design factors: a truncation in coverage due to requirements of membership in\$$\backslash$backslash\$nformal labor markets which exclude the majority of the poor, and highly generous unit benefits for\$$\backslash$backslash\$nthose in the upper quintiles. Moreover, this regressivity applies to net social insurance transfers, which\$$\backslash$backslash\$nare subsidized by government budgets at the expense of all taxpayers. The more recent emergence of\$$\backslash$backslash\$nsocial assistance only partially offsets this historical ``truncation'' of public transfers in LAC. Despite\$$\backslash$backslash\$ncoverage and distributional patterns that favor the poor, small unit subsidies limit the redistributive,\$$\backslash$backslash\$npoverty and inequality impacts of even the most targeted social assistance programs.

Top incomes represent a small share of the population but a very significant share of total income and total taxes paid. Hence, aggregate economic growth per capita and Gini inequality indexes are sensitive to excluding or including top incomes. We discuss the estimation methods and issues that arise when constructing top income share series, including income definition and comparability over time and across countries, tax avoidance, and tax evasion. We provide a summary of the key empirical findings. Most countries experience a dramatic drop in top income shares in the first part of the twentieth century in general due to shocks to top capital incomes during the wars and depression shocks. Top income shares do not recover in the immediate postwar decades. However, over the last thirty years, top income shares have increased substantially in English speaking countries and in India and China but not in continental European countries or Japan. This increase is due in part to an unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. As a result, wage income comprises a larger fraction of top incomes than in the past. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and empirical models that have been proposed to account for the facts and the main questions that remain open. (JEL D31, D63, H26, N30)},

If it is true, as some observers say, that the unified Germany is still a divided country\textemdash{}not so much in terms of material living conditions but ideologically, it is attempted to predict in what way the ideological ``inner wall'' is a fact to be reckoned with even in the future. Based on the International Social Justice Project (ISJP) data from 1991 and 1996, the focus is on particular values\textemdash{}on four justice ideologies: egalitarianism, individualism, ascriptivism, and fatalism which are derived from grid\textendash{}group theory, and it is tested whether these four ideologies form a common set of beliefs in East and West Germany. Results show that they do, but that East and West Germans have very different ideological preferences within this ideological framework. Therefore it is next tested whether the differences are rooted in cultural distinctions between the East and the West or whether they can be explained by the social positions individuals in East and West Germany hold\textemdash{}and by the rational interests attached to these positions. Using a structural equation approach to examine the genuine east\textendash{}west effects and the structural effects, we find little evidence for cultural differences but ample evidence for social structural determination. From these findings it is concluded that the ideological ``inner wall'' running through Germany is bound to fall if living conditions on both sides become even more alike.},
